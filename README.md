# MaxiDoku

MaxiDoku is a Sudoku-based puzzle game written in Flutter and Dart and
containing more than 20 different types of puzzle. It can operate in Light or
Dark display mode and has a color scheme which is potentially themeable.

You can choose the level of difficulty of any type and MaxiDoku will generate a
puzzle of that type and level for you to solve. You can also tap in a puzzle
(eg. from a newspaper). While solving, you have a Notes facility, Hints, auto
clearing of Notes and full Undo/Redo functionality.

The classic 9x9 Sudoku type is there of course, but is also available in sizes
4x4, 16x16 and 25x25 and there are several variants on the 9x9 type, such as
XSudoku in which the diagonals must also be solved. Also MaxiDoku has Killer
Sudoku, Mathdoku (aka Kenken TM) and 3D puzzles. The latter are easier than they
look. Then there are several Samurai types of puzzle, involving multiple
overlapping puzzles of a smaller type.

The game was ported to Flutter and Dart from the Linux KDE Desktop's KSudoku
game, which has been released regularly in Linux distributions since 2007.
